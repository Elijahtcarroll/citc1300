            <h2>What are Exoplanets?</h2>
            <p>Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our Solar System, and they represent one of the most intriguing discoveries in modern astronomy. Since the first exoplanets were identified in the 1990s, thousands have been discovered, revealing a diverse array of planetary systems. These distant worlds vary widely in size, composition, and location, challenging our understanding of how planets form and evolve. Some exoplanets are gas giants like Jupiter, while others are rocky planets similar to Earth. Each new discovery adds a piece to the puzzle of our cosmic neighborhood. Exploring these planets helps us learn more about the universe and our place within it.</p>

            <h3>How Do We Find Exoplanets?</h3>
            <p>Detecting exoplanets involves several sophisticated techniques that allow astronomers to study these distant worlds despite their vast distances. One common method is the transit technique, where a planet passing in front of its star causes a temporary dimming of the star’s light. Another method is the radial velocity technique, which measures the gravitational effects a planet has on its star, causing the star to wobble slightly. Direct imaging captures images of exoplanets by blocking out the star’s light, revealing details about the planet’s atmosphere and surface. Gravitational microlensing involves using the gravitational field of a star to magnify the light of a more distant star, revealing planets that might otherwise be too faint to detect. Each technique offers unique insights and helps build a comprehensive picture of exoplanetary systems.</p>
