        <h2>Discover the Universe</h2>
        <h3>Galaxies</h3>
        <p>Space is filled with galaxies, each containing billions of stars. The Milky Way, our galaxy, is just one of countless others in the universe. Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, from spiral to elliptical. The study of galaxies helps astronomers understand the structure and evolution of the cosmos. For instance, the Andromeda Galaxy is our closest large galactic neighbor and is on a collision course with the Milky Way. Such cosmic events provide insights into galactic dynamics and cosmic history.</p>
        
        <h3>Stars and Planets</h3>
        <p>Stars are massive celestial bodies that produce light and heat through nuclear fusion. They vary in size and temperature, with our Sun being a medium-sized star. Planets orbit stars and can have conditions that might support life. The study of exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, has become a major focus in astronomy. Discoveries such as the Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of distant stars fuel excitement about the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>
