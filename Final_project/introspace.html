            <h1 class="heading_style">What is a Neutron Star?</h1>
            <p>A neutron star is the remnant core of a massive star that has undergone a supernova explosion. After exhausting its nuclear fuel, the star collapses under its own gravity, compressing protons and electrons together to form neutrons. This results in an incredibly dense object, with masses typically between 1.4 and 2.16 times that of the Sun, but compressed into a sphere only about 20 kilometers in diameter.</p>
   
            <h2>Formation of Neutron Stars</h2>
            <p>Neutron stars are formed during the explosive death of a star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel. The process includes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stellar Evolution: A massive star spends millions of years fusing hydrogen into helium and progressing through heavier elements until iron is formed.</li>
                <li>Supernova Explosion: When the core collapses, the outer layers are expelled in a powerful explosion, leaving behind the core as a neutron star.</li>
                <li>Neutronization: The extreme pressure causes protons and electrons to merge into neutrons, resulting in a dense core.</li>
            </ol>
