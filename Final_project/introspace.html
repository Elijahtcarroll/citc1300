            <h1 class="heading_style">What is a Neutron Star?</h1>
            <p>A neutron star is the remnant core of a massive star that has undergone a supernova explosion. After exhausting its nuclear fuel, the star collapses under its own gravity, compressing protons and electrons together to form neutrons. This results in an incredibly dense object, with masses typically between 1.4 and 2.16 times that of the Sun, but compressed into a sphere only about 20 kilometers in diameter.</p>
   
            <h2>Formation of Neutron Stars</h2>
            <p>Neutron stars are formed during the explosive death of a star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel. The process includes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stellar Evolution: A massive star spends millions of years fusing hydrogen into helium and progressing through heavier elements until iron is formed.</li>
                <li>Supernova Explosion: When the core collapses, the outer layers are expelled in a powerful explosion, leaving behind the core as a neutron star.</li>
                <li>Neutronization: The extreme pressure causes protons and electrons to merge into neutrons, resulting in a dense core.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>characteristics of Neutron Stars</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Incredible Density: A sugar-cube-sized amount of neutron-star material would weigh about the same as all of humanity combined.</li>
                    <li>Strong Magnetic Fields: Neutron stars possess magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than Earth's, influencing their surroundings and emissions.</li>
                    <li>Rapid Rotation: Many neutron stars rotate at incredibly high speeds, with some spinning several hundred times per second.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Observations and Discoveries</h2>
            <p>Neutron stars were first discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish, who observed pulsating radio waves. Since then, astronomers have developed various observational techniques, including X-ray astronomy, to study these enigmatic objects.</p>
